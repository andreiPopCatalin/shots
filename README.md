# Project Name

This project is built with Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion, and React Colorful.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies:**

\`\`\`bash
npm install
\`\`\`

2. **Run the Development Server:**

\`\`\`bash
npm run dev
\`\`\`

This will start the development server and open the app in your browser. By default, it should be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

3. **Build the Project:**

\`\`\`bash
npm run build
\`\`\`

This will build the project for production. Once the build is complete, you can deploy it as necessary.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-side rendered applications.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds type definitions.
- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework.
- **Framer Motion**: A library for animations in React.
- **React Colorful**: A color picker component for React.

## Remained Tasks

1. **Update Export Resolution on Update from Frame Section:**
   - Update the export resolution when changes occur in the frame section to ensure that the exported content is consistent with the new frame resolution.

2. **Create Buttons Inside the Hidden Sidebar:**
   - Implement additional buttons inside the hidden sidebar. These buttons should allow users to toggle between different sections of the sidebar.

3. **Create Order Action for Undo/Redo Functionality:**
   - Implement an \`orderAction\` feature to handle undo and redo functionality. This will allow us to track the order of properties chosen and pass them to the backend in the future. A toggle system could also be considered for better user control.
